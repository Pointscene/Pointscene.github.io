    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pointscene API provides tools to analyse, manage and stream reality capture data.<br />
      By using Pointscene API you can have a faster and more predictable time from development to production.
    </p>
    <p>
      The API has built-in support for point clouds, raster files, mesh* models, images* and vector* files.<br />
      You can use the API to create custom applications that leverage existing libraries such as <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> or <a href="https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium">Cesium JS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of Pointscene API comes from fully customizable workflows.<br />
      Workflows can be used to convert data in to streaming formats, extract metadata and much more.
    </p>

      Please email us at <a href="mailto:sales@pointscene.com">sales@pointscene.com</a> for API access.

    <h2>
      Quickstart
    </h2>
    <p>
      This quickstart chapter will jump directly into the interesting bits of Pointscene API.<br />
      Pointscene API is leveraging open source components such as <a href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL</a> and <a href="https://pdal.io">PDAL</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different open source components are used as tasks and tasks are used to build workflows.<br />
      Workflows are used to manipulate and extract meaningful information from the input data.<br />
      For a more in-depth documentation and complete list of available tasks you can have a look directly at
      the docs here: <a href="https://api.pointscene.com/graphql">Pointscene GraphQL API</a>.

    <h1>Pointscene API entities</h1>
    <p>
      This chapter will explain more in-depth the different entities used in Pointscene API.<br />
      As an overview Pointscene API consists of <b>instances</b>, <b>workflows</b>, <b>resources</b> and <b>assets</b>.
      Instances are the base entity for which all the other entities, users and clients can be linked to.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>
    <p>
      Instances are the base entity used to link all resources, assets, workflows, users and clients.<br />
      Depending on your domain or business logic it may make sense to think of instances as worksites or projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can be given access to different roles linked to an instance.<br />
      Clients can be given scoped access to different instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resources and assets linked to an instance can be queried based on metadata such as geospatial extent.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Workflows
    </h2>
    <p>
      Workflows provide a way to manipulate input data.<br />
      They are constructed from tasks that carry out a specific operation and allow for a fully customizable way to process and manage business critical data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workflows and queries are consumed through <a href="/graphql/index.html">Pointscene GraphQL API</a>.<br />
      Pointscene GraphQL endpoint is located at <a href="https://api.pointscene.com/graphql">https://api.pointscene.com/graphql</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Resources can be anything from single files to complex folder structures and provide a way to manage different files and formats by extracting queryable metadata.<br />
      For example files containing geospatial information can be queried by their spatial extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known resources have generic types for rasters, point clouds, vector data, mesh models and photos.<br />
      These types will be useful when building workflows.<br />
      The workflow engine will check that the task inputs and outputs are compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resources can be created by workflows, web downloads or user uploads.<br />
      It is possible to create several different output resources from a single input resource.<br />
      For example when uploading point clouds it is possible to define a workflow that will output separate resources or assets for ortho photos, surface models and streaming point clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resources of specific types are linked as assets which can be used to stream e.g. slippy map tiles (TMS) or point clouds (Potree, EPT, 3D Tiles) over the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>
      Assets are a convenient way of accessing resources of specific types.<br />
      Compared to resources which contain generic types for the resource data, assets are of a known format.<br />
      Assets can be for example Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF's (COG), a streaming point cloud in EPT format or LandXML layers streamed as 3D Tiles.
    </p>

    <h2>
      User authentication
    </h2>
    <p>
      User authentication (OAuth2.0) is handled via REST endpoints. 
      REST API documentation can be found <a href="/rest/index.html">here*</a>.<br />
      Pointscene REST endpoint for authentication is <code>https://api.pointscene.com/oauth2</code>.
    </p>
